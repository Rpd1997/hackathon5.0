If you think back to the last holiday you had, what were the highlights that you remember? The spacious hotel room with a view of the sea? The planned excursions while you were away? Or the mouth-watering food served at the fancy restaurant you went to?

There are many people behind the scenes who make things happen so that you can enjoy your holiday, from the travel agent who booked your flights and accommodation, to the housekeeper at the hotel, and the local travel guide who showed you around.

If you’re looking for exciting career opportunities in this line of work, look no further. Here are the top 10 careers in Tourism & Hospitality.

 
<h2>1) Travel Agent</h2>

If you’re considering becoming a Travel Agent, you will need great organisational skills, attention to detail, and the ability to think on your feet. Find out more about a day in the life of a Travel Consultant here.

Event and Conference Organisers co-ordinate every detail of meetings and conferences, from the speakers and meeting locations to the printed materials and audio-visual equipment.

    <h2>7) Executive Chef</h2>

If you hear “Executive Chef”, you might think of the local celebrity chef Reuben Riffel, or the renowned UK-based chef Gordon Ramsay. The Executive Chef is in charge of a restaurant’s kitchen, and is responsible for managing the kitchen staff, planning the menu, sourcing the freshest ingredients, and making sure that food hygiene is maintained throughout the restaurant. An Executive Chef must be able to spot problems and resolve them quickly and efficiently.

If you’re passionate about cooking for a crowd and think you might have what it takes, this might be the perfect career for you.

As a Sommelier, your day might not start until 14:00, when you review your inventory, meet with suppliers, and arrange to taste wines. Before the restaurant opens for dinner, you go over the wine list with your staff. Then you work the floor, seeing to customer’s needs. Your day might not end until 01:00 or 02:00 in the morning.
<br><br>
 
    <h2>9) PR Manager</h2>

A PR Manager manages a brand’s reputation, and will plan, develop, and implement specific strategies to build and maintain the overall brand and reputation. Often, the PR Manger will also act as the company’s spokesperson. In the Tourism and Hospitality environment, a PR Manager might work for a hotel chain, a cruise company, or a game reserve.

The job will involve writing and syndicating positive press releases about the brand, arranging events at the hotel (including press conferences, exhibitions, open days, and tours) and connecting with relevant influencers in the industry. PR Managers will also have to deal with potential crisis situations. If you’re interested in becoming a PR Manager, you will have to have excellent communication and problem-solving skills.

    <h2>10) Leisure Activity Co-ordinator</h2>
